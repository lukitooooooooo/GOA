        <p>Veiqia is a female tattooing practice in Fiji.
            The term refers to both the practice and to 
            the tattoos. Women or adolescent girls who have
            reached puberty may be tattooed in the groin
            and buttocks area by older female tattooing
            specialists called dauveiqia or daubati. 
            The practice was common prior to the arrival
                in the 1830s of Christian missionaries who 
                discouraged it, but it was revived in the t
                wenty-first century. In Fijian culture, the
                tattoos were considered to heighten a woman
                's beauty and could be an important factor 
                that enabled her to marry.</p>
