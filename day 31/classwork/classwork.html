    <p style="color: blue;">The 2015 KNVB Cup final was an association football match between PEC Zwolle and FC Groningen for the 97th KNVB Cup final, the Dutch Cup competition, played on 3 May 2015 at De Kuip in Rotterdam. PEC, the defending champions after their 5–1 victory over Ajax the previous year, were appearing in their fourth final. Groningen had reached the final once before, losing to PSV Eindhoven in 1989. PEC and Groningen entered the competition in the second round and progressed through five rounds to reach the final. Groningen scored 22 goals en route, the most of any team during the qualifying rounds. In front of more than 46,000 spectators, the first half ended goalless. The Slovak Albert Rusnák scored twice halfway through the second half, leading Groningen to a 2–0 victory and their first major honour. By winning the KNVB Cup, Groningen qualified for the 2015 Johan Cruyff Shield and the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage</p>
