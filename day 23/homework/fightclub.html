    <h1>Fight Club</h1>
    <p><i>Fight Club</i> is a psychological drama about a disillusioned man 
        suffering from insomnia and a meaningless life. He meets Tyler
        Durden, a rebellious soap maker who introduces him to Fight Club
        â€” an underground group where men fight to feel alive. As the club 
        grows into a violent anti-corporate movement calledo <i>Project Mayhem</i>,
        the narrator struggles with losing control. He eventually discovers
